do-while loop 

Support for do-while was added to the comiler code. The handling is relatively similar to while, 
however, the loop body is executed first. The comiler will check for a 'while' after and evaluate 
its expression. The management after this is the same as the general while loop.

Unlike a while loop, a do-while loop's body is guaranteed to run at least once. This results in a 
different order of operations when generating assembly or intermediate code:
- The body executes first.
- The condition is checked afterward.
- The loop continues or exits based on the condition.

Moreover, error handling for when a 'while' does not follow a 'do' is also added. In this case,
the program will terminate, returning an error and a message that a while was expected after the do.
